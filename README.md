# Algorithm

Algorithm is a project primarily aimed at education and serving as a
reference guide to a vast array of widely recognised and extensively
used algorithms. The goal is to help anyone interested in
understanding and implementing algorithms in an efficient manner.

Most of the algorithms are written as C function-like macros.

## Usage

This project could be utilised as a reference guide for various
algorithms. You could use the function-like macros in your projects,
or modify them as per your requirements. It is not only an
educational resource but also a handy collection for programming
projects. The only requirement is that you must include the header
files, and you are good to go! You are also encouraged to use the
latest C standard (C2x) for compiling the code, as some of the macros
might be dependent on the latest standard.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing
place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are
**greatly appreciated**. No strict guidelines here, so all you need
is to fork the project, make your changes, and create a pull request.

We request contributors to add a detailed explanation of the algorithm
they've implemented (or their change in general,) its time and space
complexities, and anything else worth mentioning. Also, follow the
same coding style, please.
